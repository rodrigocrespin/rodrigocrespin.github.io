It centralizes cryptocurrencies market values in **real-time** and keeps an eye 24/7 of your own investment portfolio.

It's developed in **.NET** and **Angular**, and it involves a lot of market knowledge, web socket connections & real-time updates in the UI with help of reactive state.

The main idea is to make the crypto investment easy-to-use and a bit fun too. It can be used anonymously, or you can create your own user ([Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) user authentication & management).

### Asset detail view

I also included a detail view for each crypto asset to check all the asset stats and different rates, along with the historical value using [TradingView](https://tradingview.com/) charts to display the information like a pro.
