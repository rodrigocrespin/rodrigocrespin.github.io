USP is a flexible data management software environment that supports large scale screening programs but also smaller clinical trials.

With USP, the population can be organized in target groups based on different parameters (such as the clientâ€™s age, gender, living area, previous studies result, etc).

Based on these parameters each client is invited for a specific screening workflow and tracked from the first contact until the end of the screening.
